Bear Chat Log Automated Log 

This is a short Python script written to help me automate the Bear Chat logging process. 

Bear chats are 1:1 conversations Resident Assistants have with their residents at UC Berkeley ResHalls. This script is currently based on the guide for Spring 2019 Bear Chats, by UC Berkeley Residential Life.
